		<p>New Orleans (/njuː ˈɔːrlᵻnz, -ˈɔːrli.ənz, -ɔːrˈliːnz/,[4][5] or /ˈnɔːrlᵻnz/; French: La Nouvelle-Orléans [la nuvɛlɔʁleɑ̃] (About this sound listen)) is a major United States port and the largest city and metropolitan area in the state of Louisiana.

The population of the city was 343,829 as of the 2010 U.S. Census.[6][7]

The New Orleans metropolitan area (New Orleans–Metairie–Kenner Metropolitan Statistical Area) had a population of 1,167,764 in 2010 and was the 46th largest in the United States.[8] The New Orleans–Metairie–Bogalusa Combined Statistical Area, a larger trading area, had a 2010 population of 1,452,502.[9]

It is well known for its distinct French and Spanish Creole architecture, as well as its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage.[10]

New Orleans is also famous for its cuisine, music (particularly as the birthplace of jazz),[11][12] and its annual celebrations and festivals, most notably Mardi Gras, dating to French colonial times.

The city is often referred to as the "most unique"[13] in the United States.[14][15][16][17][18]

New Orleans is located in southeastern Louisiana, and developed on both sides of the Mississippi River. The heart of the city and French Quarter is on the north side of the river as it curves through this area. The city and Orleans Parish (French: paroisse d'Orléans) are coterminous.[19] The city and parish are bounded by the parishes of St. Tammany to the north, St. Bernard to the east, Plaquemines to the south, and Jefferson to the south and west.[19][20][21] Lake Pontchartrain, part of which is included in the city limits, lies to the north and Lake Borgne lies to the east.[21]

Before Hurricane Katrina, Orleans Parish was the most populous parish in Louisiana. As of 2015,[22] it ranks third in population, trailing neighboring Jefferson Parish, and East Baton Rouge Parish.[22]</p>
